CFA SEM overview
- What is SEM
   - measurement model
   - structural model
- Basic SEM conventions

CFA SEM with Lavaan R package
- What is Lavaan
- Major operators of Lavaan syntax
   - Defining a reflective latent variable
   - Estimate factor covariance
   - Insert a comment in the syntax
   - Label a parameter
   - Create a new parameter

Main Steps in SEM
- Dataset
- Step 1: Defining individual constructs
- Step 2: Developing overall measurement
(Let's practice)
- Step 3: Assessing measurement validity
    - Basic principle
    - Summary output
      - Overall results
	- Number of model parameters
	- Degrees of freedom
	- Interpret Chi-square
      - Loadings
      - Variances
    - Fit indices
      - Goodness of fit indices
	- Comparative Fit index (CFI)
	- Tucker Lewis Index (TLI)
      - Badness of fit indices
	- Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)
	- Standardized root mean squarer residual (SRMR)
(Let's practice)
    - Reliability and validity tests
        - sample from a journal
	- composite reliability (alpha)
	- Avarage variance extracted (AVE)
	- Discriminant validity
(Let's practice)
- Step 4: Specifying the structural model
    - Notes on proceeding from CFA to structural
    - Highlight the differences in CFA to SEM (through a diagram)
    - Defining structural theory
	- Hypothesized relationship of the factors
    - Illustrate how to do path diagram using semPaths()
(Let's practice)

- Step 5: Assessing structural model validity
    - Fit indeces
    - Compare fit indices in CFA model and structural model
- What's next?
   - Modification indices
   - Heywood cases
   - Comparing competing models
   - Formative scales in SEM
   - Higher-order factor analysis
